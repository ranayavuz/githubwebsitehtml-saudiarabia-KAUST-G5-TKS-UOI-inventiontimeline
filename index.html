      <h2>the first humans</h2>
      <p>the first humans had no tools. they used only sticks and unshaped rocks. we didnt cooperate well and were easily eaten by predators like lions. but then, 2.5 MILLION years ago, 
        everything changed.</p>
      <br/>
      <p> a human species called Homo Hablis started to shape rocks by smashing them together and they had a bigger brain than earlier humans. now humans had something to protect themselves.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>1.5 million years ago, we invented a very crucial thing, FIRE! we could now have warmth and light, we learned to make torches. now we could scare predators away and set fire to forests.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>200,000 years ago, our human species, Homo Sapien, had evolved. but... 70,000 years ago we made stories, religon, and started to form big groups, we were still nomadic though, because we didnt invent farming yet.</p>
